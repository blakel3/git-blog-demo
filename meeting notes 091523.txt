-double undulated surface
	-high frequency, ~a couple cell lengths
	-~20-25,000
	-positive defects at peaks
	-leonard-jones sticky surface potential
	-look for double layer nucleating at boundary

	-cell to cell adhesion term?
	-where along cell length do we measure distance for cell-surface adhesion term?

	-add in-progress file to github
